PrograMusic's Image Search works without a registration procedure, so we don't store any information that's yours. We don't store the content you find or the webpages you visit.

We delegate the temporary Image uploads to imgbb.com , by using the app you agree to their terms of service[https://imgbb.com/tos] and privacy policy [https://imgbb.com/privacy] as well.

The images are hosted anonymously and are deleted after a period of time. This period of time may be subject to change. But the images are, and will always be deleted in short time.

Each search engine will handle the image in a different manner, some may don't record data, some may save fingerprints. This depends on each engine. We can't be accountable for the operations that the engines do. or the searches that you do.

So in short. We, don't collect any data. At all. However the third party hosting and search engines may do. Be aware of that.
