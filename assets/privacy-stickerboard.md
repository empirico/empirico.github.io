**Introduction**

Programusic ("we," "us," or "our") provides the Stickerboard mobile application ("App"). This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how we collect, use, and disclose information in connection with your use of the App.

**Information We Collect**

We collect two types of information through the App:

* **Non-Personal Information:** This information does not identify you personally and may include:
    * Device type
    * Operating system
    * IP address (anonymized)
    * Usage statistics (e.g., analytics)
* **No Personal Information:** Stickerboard does not require an account and does not collect any personal information about you such as name, email address, contacts, or message content.

**How We Use Your Information**

We use non-personal information to:

* Improve the App and user experience
* Analyze trends and usage patterns
* Administer the App and deliver targeted advertising (Free Version Only)

**Free Version with Ads (AdMob)**

The free version of Stickerboard uses AdMob by Google to display non-personalized advertisements. AdMob may collect limited device information to deliver targeted ads based on your interests. Please refer to Google's AdMob Privacy Policy for details: [https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)

**Paid Pro Version**

The Pro version of Stickerboard is completely ad-free and does not collect any additional information compared to the free version.

**Image Download and Copyright**

Stickerboard allows you to search for images on the web and download them as stickers. We strive to ensure users only download and share copyright-free images. However, due to the vast nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the copyright status of all images. We recommend users exercise caution and only download and share images they believe are free to use.

**Sharing Your Information**

We do not share your information with any third parties beyond those necessary for the operation of the App (e.g., AdMob in the free version). We do not sell or rent your information to anyone.

**Security**

We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is completely secure. 

**Children's Privacy**

Our App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

**Changes to this Policy**

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on the App.
